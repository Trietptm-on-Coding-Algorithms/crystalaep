  The Crystal AEP product checks for updates each time it is run. When an update is available the following dialog box is displayed to the user:

  Upon acceptance the download should be downloaded, the previous version of Crystal removed (a reboot is then required) and the update should install when the system powers up again.<br><br>
  
  In the event that the update process does not work, please download the latest version of Crystal AEP from <font color="blue">http://www.crystalaep.com/download.htm</font>
